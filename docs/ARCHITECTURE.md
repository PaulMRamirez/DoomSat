# DoomSat architecture and design notes

The long form of what used to be the README: how the stack is wired, what the player side is allowed to see,
the decision graph, the integration findings, and the history of the 22 September audit. Install and run
instructions are in the [README](../README.md).

## Architecture

![Architecture](diagrams/architecture.png)

## Data flow

Every message, its type and its rate, from the game to the models and back:

The dashboard (`tools/serve_dashboard.py`, everything on it comes from Yamcs) during a live jev run:

## What the player side is allowed to see

The rule for this demo: jev and code go in blind, like a person who knows how to play Doom but has never seen
the level. Nothing from the WAD reaches the payload or the models.

| Sense | What it stands in for | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Depth buffer (range camera) | where the walls are | ViZDoom depth buffer; calibrated: 7.16 map units per step, perpendicular distance |
| Object labels | recognising monsters, pickups, keys, barrels | ViZDoom labels buffer (only things in view) |
| In-game automap, *seen lines only* | the map a player sees on Tab | ZDoom automap in `NORMAL` mode: lines the player has looked at, in the engine's default categories (wall, floor step, ceiling change = door, locked door in its key colour, exit line); only the colours are changed so code can read them |
| HUD variables | health, armor, ammo, position, heading | ViZDoom game variables |

Not used: whole-map or "show objects" automap modes, the "show trigger lines" option, sector/line geometry
from the game state, monster counts, item lists, warp cheats. `tools/wad_stats.py` reads WADs but only as a
developer check for choosing levels and verifying results; the payload never imports it.

There is no route planner onboard. The payload (`payload/doom_payload.py`) stamps the automap into a world raster,
sweeps the floor it has seen with the range camera, remembers where it has walked, and reports eight directions
around the player (every 45 degrees): how far the way is open on the map, whether the ground that way is
unexplored, new, or walked before, and — on its own channel — how far off a door lies that way. It also reports
what is at arm's length ahead (a wall, a door, the exit switch, a locked door, something the map does not show),
where an exit line, a key or a pickup was seen, and whether the player is stuck. Obstacles the automap does not
draw (window bars, fake doors, barrels) are learned by pushing against them once. jev scores those words every
~0.5 s; every number is bucketed before jev sees it.

**Nothing survives an attempt.** Every episode, including a retry of the same level, starts with an empty world
model: no raster, no barrier marks, no door memory. The payload used to keep the map between attempts on the
reasoning that a player remembers a layout, and the effect was that every run after the first began on a level
it already believed was walled in (`EXPLORED_CELLS` 662 against 1 for a fresh one) — which is level knowledge,
and it confounded an afternoon of measurement before anyone noticed. `docs/CHARTER.md` §2.2 makes it a rule and
`research/honesty.py` makes it a test.

One more thing a player cannot do is read an exit line's colour from across a level, so an exit is only
*recognised* while it has been within 512 units and drawn on the automap this attempt; recognition is then
remembered, the way seeing a thing is. `EXIT_LINE_MAX_UNITS` in `payload/doom_payload.py`, 0 to remove exit
colouring entirely.

## The decision graph

jev classifies. It does not reason, plan or remember, so the graph asks it only the judgments that have no
exact rule behind them, and code does the rest:

| Head | Type | Asked | What code does with it |
|---|---|---|---|
| `target` | Score, 9 levels | once per candidate the onboard world model offers, every decision | picks with commitment and an unsure band, plans the path, sends the INTENT |
| `engage` | Choice | only when something has actually been met | sets the mode and the stance |
| `weapon` | Choice | with `engage` | the slot to hold, with the splash rule as a backstop |
| `need` | Score, 4 levels | every `goal_every` decisions | re-weights the candidates a detour would serve |
| `sector` | Score, 9 levels | the pre-charter navigator, kept for comparison and as executor input | ranks the eight directions with hysteresis on a **world bearing** |

The rubric behind `target` asks for the trade-offs no single field settles: what is standing near the
target against the health and ammunition there is to spend on it, how far it is *relative to the other
options*, whether a detour answers a need that is real now. `targeting.rule_score` is the null hypothesis
and is deliberately blind to all of that — exit, key, untried door, nearest unexplored edge. Writing the
rubric as a restatement of the rule is how the old `sector` head ended up agreeing with ten lines of code
89% of the time, which made the model redundant by construction; a test now guards the separation.

Walking, doors, firing, weapon selection, aiming and the mode machine (EXPLORE, APPROACH, OPERATE, FIGHT,
RETREAT, RECOVER) are exact rules, so they live in `ground/decision_graph.py` and `payload/executor.py`,
not in a question. Four things
follow from jev being stateless and literal, and code holds all four:

1. every fact a criterion mentions exists as a field of the state — `decision_graph.lint` refuses a graph
   that names one that does not, and checks the question text **as rendered**, after `{dir}` substitution;
2. anything that depends on the past is computed by code and written as a present-tense field (`NavMemory`):
   the committed direction is kept as a world bearing, so "keep going left" cannot mean a new direction
   after every turn;
3. any rule code can compute exactly stays in code;
4. every threshold on an answer has an unsure band and a **named** fallback, so a near-tie is never a coin flip.

`ground/graph_config.py` **rejects** a revision it cannot accept rather than trimming it, and hands the
reason back to System Two for one more try. The old version silently cut every string to 700 characters and
clamped the hysteresis margin, so ten of the last eleven reviews re-diagnosed the same truncation and every
tuning of the margin was a no-op. See `docs/audit-2026-09-22.md`.

## The rover split (charter 3)

The ground no longer sends buttons for one tic. It sends an **INTENT** with a time to live — a mode,
somewhere to go, a stance, what to shoot at, which weapon, whether to press Use on arrival — and the
onboard executor carries it out at 35 Hz. The player never stands still waiting for a decision.

| Tier | Where | Rate | Decides |
|---|---|---|---|
| Executor | payload (`executor.py`) | every tic | nothing strategic: follows the planned path, avoids what the camera sees, aims, fires, presses Use, and has the watchdog that pulls the player out of a freeze |
| World model | payload (`world_model.py`) | 5 Hz | frontiers, the object table, A* with commitment, and the candidate targets it offers the ground |
| Decider (jev) | ground (`targeting.py`) | 2 to 4 a second | which target, whether to fight, which weapon, what the player needs |
| Reviewer (Sonnet) | ground | per attempt | proposes experiments; nothing auto-applies |

`docs/CHARTER.md` is the mission and the rules; `docs/CHARTER-STATUS.md` and `docs/PHASES-2-6.md` say what
is built and what the numbers actually say, including where they say it is not finished.

## What is proven

- F´ dictionary -> XTCE -> Yamcs: 148 parameters / 54 commands load; every Doom channel decodes.
- Image products: each JPEG frame (320x240, ~8 KB) is split onboard into 960-byte `FrameChunk` telemetry
  records that bypass `Svc.TlmChan` sampling (straight into the com queue, APID 1) and ride the CCSDS TM frames;
  the ground reassembles ~10 fps with <1% loss and publishes them to the Yamcs bucket `doomframes`
  (`/DoomGround/DoomFrame` carries the URL for Open MCT and the dashboard).
- Uplink: CONTROL commands every ~0.5 s; the F´ command dispatcher, the Doom component and the payload all
  report them (events `OpCodeDispatched/Completed`, `GoalSet`, `LevelStarted`, `KeyPickedUp`).
- jev: one request per decision carrying a Score for each open direction (plus `danger` and, every 10th tick,
  `goal`), ~460 ms median including the Yamcs round trip; every decision row in `out/decisions.jsonl` carries
  the TypeSafe request id **and the exact state that was sent**, so a run can be replayed against a new graph
  without the game (`tools/replay.py`).
- File uplink and `LOAD_WAD` (3 October 2026, see the README's "Uplink a new level" and
  `docs/plans/wad-uplink-stage1.md`): a WAD goes up as F´ file packets (fprime-yamcs `FprimeFilePacketService`,
  APID 3, 512-byte chunks, about 25 KB/s) to `NAME.<nonce>.part`. FileUplink verifies the checksum and announces
  the file on `fileAnnounce`, and the Doom component renames it to `NAME`. `LOAD_WAD` then has the payload prove
  the game in a child process and rebuild its `DoomGame` in place. The F´ binary, Yamcs and the flight link stay
  up throughout. Command round trips stay around 100 ms during an uplink.
- CFDP (4 October 2026, `docs/plans/cfdp-stage2-spike.md`): the same uplink as CCSDS CFDP class 2, Yamcs
  `CfdpService` to F´ `Svc/Ccsds/CfdpManager` in place of FileUplink/FileDownlink, PDUs on APID 3 behind the
  F´ file descriptor, wrapped and unwrapped by stream SQL (`ground/yamcs/etc/cfdp_streams.sql`). At 5 % frame
  loss each way the native file packets failed 3 of 3 and CFDP class 2 delivered every file whole; `COMMIT_WAD`
  takes the place of `fileAnnounce`. 25 KB/s at Yamcs's 40 ms PDU pacing, 180 KB/s at 5 ms; downlink about
  63 KB/s (64 PDUs a second). Commands ride TC virtual channel 1 ahead of the file's channel 2.
- Claude Sonnet 5 via the `claude` CLI as the after-action reviewer: one tool-free schema call per episode,
  returning the revised graph. The CLI runs with `DISABLE_NON_ESSENTIAL_MODEL_CALLS=1`, so no helper-model calls;
  `--system-two anthropic` uses the API directly.

Integration findings worth keeping:
1. F´ `string` telemetry is serialized length-prefixed, but `fprime-xtce` emits a fixed-size string type, so
   Yamcs rejects every packet carrying one (the string channel became an enum).
2. Opaque byte arrays need the `!binary` annotation (`fprime-xtce` PR #8, installed from the branch); the
   whole-struct form rejects array members, the array form works.
3. `FW_COM_BUFFER_MAX_SIZE` must be raised (512 -> 1000) through a `CONFIGURATION_OVERRIDES` config module
   (`flight/config`), not `settings.ini`'s `config_directory`.
4. `Svc.LinuxTimer` must tick faster than 1 Hz or the `ComAggregator` holds the last chunk of a frame until its
   timeout; the deployment runs a 20 Hz base clock.
5. Yamcs delivers F´ booleans as the strings "True"/"False"; a Yamcs bucket holds at most 1000 objects (image
   products are written into a ring of 20 names); the parameter WebSocket drops after a few minutes.
6. The ViZDoom depth buffer is perpendicular (z) distance at 7.16 units per step, its value 0 is the sky, and the
   crosshair is drawn into it; the automap draws the player arrow over the lines beneath it.
7. A truncated WAD does not raise in ViZDoom 1.3.0. `init()` prints "Failed to allocate memory from system heap"
   and the process dies with SIGSEGV, which is why `LOAD_WAD` proves a WAD in a child process first.
8. F´ v4.3.0 command string arguments are capped at `FW_CMD_STRING_MAX_SIZE` (40) on board, whatever
   `string size N` declares. That includes FileManager's 240-character paths, which fail with FORMAT_ERROR above
   40. Yamcs also counts the two-byte length tag against the declared size, so `string size 40` carries 38
   characters.
9. FileUplink opens its destination without truncating it, writes into it while it arrives, and keeps a file
   that failed its checksum. F´ file packets are not retransmitted, so a single packet lost on the TC link
   fails the whole file (seen: `PacketOutOfOrder`, then `BadChecksum`). Hence the fresh `.part` name per
   uplink and the rename only on `fileAnnounce`.
10. fprime-yamcs regenerates the XTCE from the build's dictionary every time it starts, so
    `ground/yamcs/mdb/fprime.xtce.xml` is a reference copy that Yamcs does not load.
11. F´ v4.3.0's `FileHandlingCfdp` subtopology does not compile (it calls `configure` with one argument of
    three), and its stock 1024-byte `MaxPduSize` makes the first full downlinked PDU assert in `ComAggregator`
    (1001 fits). CFDP class 1 keeps a file whose checksum failed and reports it completed: WADs go class 2.
12. fprime-yamcs rewrites the instance YAML with sorted keys, which puts a `streamConfig` `sqlFile` before the
    streams it reads; `ground/yamcs/launch.py` writes it back in order. Yamcs packs several TC packets into one
    frame unless told not to, and F´'s deframer keeps only the first (`multiplePacketsPerFrame: false`).

## Layout

| Path | What |
|---|---|
| `flight/Components/Doom/` | F´ component: commands, 64 telemetry channels, events, FrameChunk downlink (frames and the map product) (FPP + C++) |
| `flight/DoomSat/Top/`, `flight/config/` | topology/instances/rate groups, com-buffer override (copied into the WSL project) |
| `payload/doom_payload.py` | the game as an instrument: automap (seen lines) + range camera + labels, local sensing in eight directions, level progression |
| `payload/world_model.py` | the world model for one attempt: frontiers, the object table, A* with commitment, and the candidate targets the ground scores |
| `payload/executor.py` | the onboard executor: follows an INTENT with a time to live at 35 Hz, avoids what the camera sees, aims, fires, and has the watchdog that pulls the player out of a freeze |
| `payload/speed_probe.py`, `payload/ray_class_probe.py` | the two measurements that settled a constant and a hypothesis: running speed, and what actually stops a collapsed map ray |
| `payload/selfplay.py`, `payload/nav_probe.py` | code-only drivers of the navigator (no models) for fast iteration |
| `ground/pilot.py` | the loop: Yamcs subscriptions, frame reassembly, jev control step, after-action reviews, commands |
| `ground/decision_graph.py` | telemetry -> a structured state, the sector heads, the mode machine, the selection rules, the reflex layer, the criteria linter |
| `ground/targeting.py` | the charter's navigator: candidate targets -> words -> the `target`, `need`, `engage` and `weapon` heads -> a pick with commitment -> an INTENT. The code baselines live beside them and are deliberately simpler |
| `ground/graph_config.py` | the graph as data, with bounds code enforces by rejecting (versioned in `ground/graph/`) |
| `ground/metrics.py` | one frozen definition per number the runs are compared on, shared by the report and the replay |
| `ground/after_action.py` | the episode report (built from the heads actually asked) and the System Two review call |
| `ground/providers.py` | System One: TypeSafe (jev) or any OpenAI-compatible endpoint; System Two: Claude CLI, Anthropic API or OpenAI-compatible |
| `ground/yamcs/`, `ground/openmct/`, `ground/dashboard/` | Yamcs config + ground XTCE, Open MCT config, the mission dashboard page |
| `docs/` | diagrams (Graphviz sources + renders), report (`doomsat-report.md/.tex/.pdf`), handoff (`HANDOFF.md`), images, charts, `video/` |
| `runs/<date>/` | the day's decision logs (one row per jev decision: **the exact state sent**, the answers, the selection detail, request id, latency, telemetry), pilot log, final graph, map, replay results |
| `docs/CHARTER.md` | the mission, the knowledge boundary, the architecture and the build order; `docs/CHARTER-STATUS.md` says what of it is built |
| `knowledge/doom_rules.yaml` | how Doom works: monsters, weapons, ammo, pickups, keys, doors, damaging floors. Values only, no level ever named |
| `research/` | the ruler. `PROGRAM.md` (the rules of the loop), `levels.yaml` (dev and test sets, and every charter decision as one value), `frozen_metrics.py`, `honesty.py`, `preflight.py`, `runner.py` (bench and flight), `grade.py`, `ledger.py` + `ledger.tsv`, `experiment.py` (one experiment end to end), `campaign.py` (the test campaign, run by a person) |
| `research/grader/` | the only code allowed to open a WAD, in its own process: walkability, the distance field, the score. It refuses to import inside a pilot |
| `tests/` | `python -m unittest discover -s tests` — 274 tests, no network and no game: the state, the selection, the modes, the reflex layer, the graph contract, the report's head coverage, the honesty suite and its canary, the grader and the keep rule |
| `scripts/`, `tools/` | start/stop/build helpers (WSL), replay and boundary-set tools, run report, charts, decision-graph figures, screenshots/recording, developer probes |

## Who decides what

| Layer | Runs | Decides |
|---|---|---|
| Flight code (F´ + payload) | 35 Hz / 20 Hz | safety (uplink loss -> hold), heading setpoint loop, the map, the eight-sector sensing, door and barrier memory, door/switch attempts |
| Ground code (the pilot) | every ~0.5 s | the mode machine and every transition in it, walking, doors, firing, weapon selection, aiming, sidestepping, the hysteresis, the unsure fallback, and a reflex layer that never fires at zero ammo, never walks into a known wall and never re-commands a turn still in flight |
| System One: jev | every ~0.5 s, live | the judgments with no exact rule behind them: one Score per open direction (how promising it is for reaching the exit) on a shared 4-level rubric, one Score for how dangerous the scene is when an enemy is in view, and every 10th tick the `goal` Choice |
| System Two: Claude Sonnet 5 | every minute, and after an episode | every minute: reads the map product and the recent walk and pushes exploration in a direction (`EXPLORE_HINT`, optionally `SET_GOAL`); after an episode (death, level finished, or the 3-minute level budget spent -> `RESET_GAME`): reads the after-action report and revises the graph — wording, rubric levels and the numbers in `thresholds` and `select`. A revision outside the bounds is rejected with the reason and it gets one more try |

![Decision graph](diagrams/decision_graph.png)

![One decision end to end](diagrams/decision_flow.png)

Nothing slower than jev sits in the live loop. The graph is data (`ground/graph_config.py`); every revision is
validated by code (fixed head names and types, bounded text, numeric ranges, and a lint of every state field
the criteria name) and stored as `ground/graph/graph_v<N>.json` with Sonnet's rationale in
`ground/graph/CHANGELOG.md`. The System One model is **pinned** to `jev-1.13.0` rather than `jev-latest`,
because the numbers in `select` are tuned against one version.

## Status (22 September 2026)

The stack works end to end under load and every layer is measured; the autonomous player explores, opens the
first door and dies honestly, but does not yet finish E1M1. The report `docs/doomsat-report.md` (also `.tex`
and `.pdf`) has the numbers, the data flow, the results per cycle and the reasons. `docs/HANDOFF.md` is the
handoff for the next pass. `python tools/run_report.py` prints the current run.

Later the same day, an audit of the decision graph found fourteen issues — most of them in the code around jev,
not in jev's answers — and the graph was rewritten against them. **`docs/audit-2026-09-22.md` is the record:**
what changed per issue, what the replay measured, and what it did not settle. The short version:

- Every System Two edit had been silently cut at 700 characters and the hysteresis margin silently clamped, so
  ten of the last eleven reviews re-diagnosed the same truncation and every tuning of the margin was a no-op.
  Code now rejects a revision it cannot accept and hands the reason back for one more try.
- The direction commitment was the *word* "left", which names a new direction after every turn. It is now a
  world bearing, so holding a direction becomes walking rather than another 90 degrees.
- Four of the eight heads were asking jev to re-derive rules code already had. They are code now, and the
  `danger` Score — a judgment with no exact rule — took their place.
- The unsure band was first written as "a near tie **and** low confidence" and never fired once in 116 replayed
  states: each sector is scored by its own isolated question, so its `confidence` says nothing about how it
  ranks against the others. The band is on the gap, and the threshold (0.10 rubric levels) comes from replay:
  below it jev's own ranking flips ~30% between identical passes; at or above it, 0 of 51 states flipped.
- The honest check the audit asked for is now a gate, not a footnote: `tools/replay.py --pilots code,jev` runs
  the same states through jev and through a code-only function that encodes the rubric exactly. The rubric as
  written is close to a function of four enum fields, so jev reproduces it and adds little. That is the
  argument for the next pass — evidence no rule can read (the surface classifier), not a different question.
- **Flying it found three freezes that no test caught**, because each is a property of a sequence of ticks
  rather than of one decision: OPERATE could not give up, so the pilot stood at one door for 1,172
  consecutive decisions commanding nothing; FIGHT triggered on bare visibility, so it spent 211 decisions
  staring at an enemy 2,139 units away; and the reflex "never walk into a known wall" deadlocked the stuck
  detector that depends on the player pushing, so it sat in one spot for 553 decisions with `STUCK` false.
  All three are fixed and all three now have tests.
- **The first comparison was wrong twice over.** It used the old run's *first* 150 seconds — the best of
  its 27 windows — and every new-graph run had started on a map the payload had already filled with
  barrier marks from the run before (`EXPLORED_CELLS` 662 at the start, against 1 for the baseline). From a
  restarted payload and matched windows, the new graph's median beats **27 of 27** old windows on cells
  explored and on distance walked, and its worst window clears the old median on all three measures. The
  spin metric was also partly measuring the new design, which waits out its turns, so there is now a
  fixed-time window alongside the per-tick one — and small corrections are taken while walking.
- **The state churn was split into its causes** (`tools/churn_check.py`). Two fifths of the apparent churn
  on turning ticks was the egocentric labels sliding under the readings; bin edges accounted for ~3%; the
  rest is the payload re-sensing the same world direction differently. Sector words are now held against
  the ray's world bearing, and a *better* reading has to be confirmed while a *worse* one is believed at
  once — a third less churn for lag that can only ever delay good news.
- **The four-level rubric was saturated**: scores clustered at 2.7–2.9, the median gap between the top two
  was 0.08 levels, the fallback fired on 43% of ticks, and a visible exit tied with any fresh corridor.
  Nine levels now, with the exit at the top. Flown, the median gap is ~1.0 levels and the fallback ~10%.

Recordings of the last run of the day, 1080p, jev live through the stack:

- `docs/video/doomsat_dashboard_1080p.mp4`: the mission dashboard (frames, telemetry, jev's decisions, Sonnet's bumps and reviews, F´ events, the command archive, the map product), all read from Yamcs.
- `docs/video/doomsat_stack_1080p.mp4`: the dashboard, the Yamcs telemetry page, the Yamcs command history and Open MCT side by side.
