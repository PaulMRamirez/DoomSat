# fprime-yamcs stamps F´ times 1 s ahead

**Finding.** Every F´ telemetry point and event in Yamcs carried a generation time 1 s later than the moment it
was made. fprime-yamcs's packet preprocessor adds 38 s where Yamcs adds 37. **Fix.** `tools/yamcs_time_patch.py`
changes that one constant in the installed jar; `scripts/setup_flight.sh fprime` runs it. **Upstream.** A draft
issue for fprime-community/fprime-yamcs is at the end, for the owner to file.

## What was wrong

- F´ stamps its own time correctly. `Svc.ChronoTime` (the time source in `flight/DoomSat/Top`) sets
  `TB_WORKSTATION_TIME` from `std::chrono::system_clock`: Unix seconds and microseconds, truncated, nothing added.
- Yamcs keeps time as an *instant*, milliseconds on a TAI-based scale. Its own conversion,
  `TimeEncoding.fromUnixMillisec`, adds TAI−UTC, which has been 37 s since 1 January 2017. Measured on the
  bundled Yamcs 5.12.8: instant − Unix milliseconds = 37 000 ms.
- `com.example.myproject.FprimePacketPreprocessor` (fprime-yamcs's jar) computes the generation time itself:
  `(seconds + 38) * 1000 + microseconds / 1000`. In the bytecode, at offset 275: `bipush 38`, `istore 9`, then
  the seconds read from the packet are added to it.
- So each F´ packet reached Yamcs 1 s in the future. The class is byte for byte the same in 0.2.1 (pinned) and
  0.2.4 (the latest, 30 September 2026): SHA-256 `3f226b4b…9f301a1a`. Upgrading would not fix it.

## What it touched

- **Wrong by 1 s:**
  - every F´ parameter and event in Yamcs, so its archive and every display that reads it;
  - the SDS (`ground/sds`), which takes generation times for F´ telemetry and events but Yamcs's own time for
    commands, so a command-to-effect interval was 1 s long.
- **Already worked around:** Open MCT's live window ends 5 s after now (`ground/openmct/doomsat/common.js`).
  With an end of now, the gauges dropped every live value as "in the future". The camera's frame age read
  23:59:59 for the same reason.
- **Not touched:** the pilot's telemetry age (`tel_age_ms`) and every research metric. They use the ground
  clock, not F´'s timestamps.
- **Not corrected by the fix:** data recorded before it (the Yamcs archive, SDS captures). Those keep the
  extra second.

## The fix

`tools/yamcs_time_patch.py` rewrites `bipush 38` as `bipush 37` in `FprimePacketPreprocessor.class`, inside the
installed `fprime-yamcs-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar`:
- **Only the known class.** It patches only when the class hashes to the known unpatched one, and the result
  to the known patched one (`d40eb38b…879497bf`). Any other build is left alone, with a warning.
- **Nothing else changes.** Every other entry, with its date and compression, is copied as it is. The new jar
  replaces the old in one rename.
- **Reversible.** The jar as installed stays beside it as `fprime-yamcs-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar.orig`. fprime-yamcs
  loads `jars/*.jar` only, so the backup is never on the classpath.
- **Safe to repeat.** Running it twice changes nothing more.

Where it runs:
- `scripts/setup_flight.sh fprime` applies it after installing fprime-yamcs.
- `scripts/flight.sh start` prints one line when the jar is not patched.
- `tools/doctor.py` reports it.
- For an install made before this change, run `scripts/flight.sh setup fprime`, or
  `~/doom/DoomSat/fprime-venv/bin/python tools/yamcs_time_patch.py`.

Why a patch and not a plugin:
- A DoomSat preprocessor in Java would need a JDK at setup, because the runtime fprime-yamcs ships has the
  `java.compiler` API but not the compiler.
- Correcting downstream instead would leave Yamcs's archive and every display 1 s wrong.
- The tool's name keeps it clear of `flight.sh stop`, which kills anything whose command line matches
  `fprime_yamc[s]`.

**Limit.** 37 is today's TAI−UTC. No leap second has been added since 2017, and they are to stop by 2035. If one
were added, the constant would be 1 s off again. The upstream fix below has no such constant.

## Verified (6 October 2026, this container)

Generation time minus Yamcs's reception time, read from the archive while the stack flew:

| | F´ telemetry (median, n) | F´ events (median, n) |
|---|---|---|
| Before (fprime-yamcs as installed) | +943 ms (200; min +809, max +998) | +955 ms (67) |
| After `tools/yamcs_time_patch.py` | −58 ms (300; min −386, max −1) | −41 ms (17) |

Before, the lead was 1 s minus the link's own delay. After, the generation time comes before the reception time,
as it should.

Tests: `tests/test_yamcs_time_patch.py` patches a jar built at test time, with no install and no network:
- only the known class and only that byte change;
- the backup is kept once and is not a `*.jar`;
- an unknown class, or a known hash with two sites, is left alone;
- the exit codes.

When an F´ install is present, it also checks that the installed jar is one this knows.

## Draft upstream issue (for the owner to file at fprime-community/fprime-yamcs)

> **FprimePacketPreprocessor adds 38 s to F´ time; Yamcs's TAI−UTC is 37 s, so every packet is stamped 1 s
> in the future**
>
> `FprimePacketPreprocessor.process` sets the generation time as `(seconds + 38) * 1000 + useconds / 1000`.
> Yamcs's own conversion from Unix time, `TimeEncoding.fromUnixMillisec`, adds the current TAI−UTC, which has
> been 37 s since 2017. With F´'s `TB_WORKSTATION_TIME` (Unix seconds and microseconds, e.g. from
> `Svc.ChronoTime` or `Svc.PosixTime`), every F´ parameter and event in Yamcs therefore reads 1 s later than it
> was made.
>
> Seen with fprime-yamcs 0.2.1 and 0.2.4 (the class is identical), Yamcs 5.12.8:
> - In the archive, generation time minus reception time is +943 ms median for telemetry, +955 ms for events.
>   It should be slightly negative, by the link delay.
> - `TimeEncoding.fromUnixMillisec(System.currentTimeMillis()) - System.currentTimeMillis()` is 37 000.
> - Open MCT's gauges in real-time mode, with the window ending at now, discard every live value as later than
>   the end of the window.
>
> Suggested fix: compute
> `TimeEncoding.fromUnixMillisec(seconds * 1000L + useconds / 1000)` instead of adding a constant. That also
> follows any leap-second table Yamcs is configured with. Workaround in use: change `bipush 38` to
> `bipush 37` in the class.
