module DoomMission {

    @ The CFDP uplink's gatekeeper, on both of cfdpManager's paths.
    @ Up (router -> cfdpManager): a Metadata PDU whose destination is not an uplinked WAD in the uplink directory
    @ (NAME.wad.<nonce>.part, see Doom/WadPath.hpp) never reaches cfdpManager, so CFDP writes nothing anywhere else.
    @ Down (cfdpManager -> com queue): when cfdpManager's own FIN for an upload the guard let through says the file
    @ arrived whole (no error, retained), the guard announces the file to the Doom component, which renames it to
    @ NAME.wad. The commit happens on board, with no ground command.
    @ Every PDU is read with F´'s own CFDP classes, the ones cfdpManager reads it with, so the two cannot disagree.

        @ cfdpManager hands the buffer back unread: handing it back to the router from here would deadlock, because
        @ the router is still inside its guarded dataIn.
