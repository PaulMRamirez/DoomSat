 *
 * RX CHUNKS -
 * For Class 2 CFDP receive transactions, the receiver must track which file segments
 * have been successfully received. A chunk represents a contiguous range (offset, size)
 * of received file data. By tracking received chunks, the receiver can identify gaps
 * in the file data and generate NAK PDUs to request retransmission of missing segments.
 *
 * (array size must be NumChannels)
 * CFDP_CHANNEL_NUM_RX_CHUNKS_PER_TRANSACTION is an array for each channel indicating
 * the number of chunks per transaction to track received file segments. This enables
 * gap detection and NAK generation for reliable Class 2 transfers.

// DoomSat: 2048 on channel 0 (stock: NakMaxSegments, 58). With 58, a receive that loses more than about 57 runs of
// PDUs forgets data it already has, and the next NAK asks for the rest of the file again: a 4.2 MB upload at 5 %
// loss resent 5,590 PDUs to cover 238 lost. 2048 covers a 28.8 MB IWAD at 5 % loss; each NAK still carries the
// first NakMaxSegments gaps, and the next one the rest. 2048 x 8 bytes x 50 transactions: about 800 KB.

 * CFDP_CHANNEL_NUM_TX_CHUNKS_PER_TRANSACTION is an array for each channel indicating
