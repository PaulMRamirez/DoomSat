"""Phase D, the file seam: the payload's own record of an episode, requested, downlinked and checked against L1.

    sds_record_watch (every 2 minutes)  -> one sds_record run per recent episode, run id rec__<episode id>
    sds_record:  plan_request -> send_SendFile_command -> wait_for_downlinked_file -> ingest_record -> compare_with_l1
                                                                               \\-> report_downlink_events (always)

This is the one place the data system commands anything, and the only command is cfdpManager's SendFile: the
task that sends it is named for it. It is off unless scripts/sds.sh runs with DOOMSAT_SDS_RECORDS=on, and it
only finds a file if the flight runs with RECORDS=on (payload/episode_record.py).

Only episodes whose payload ran with --records on (the episode's cataloged context says so) and that closed in
the last two hours are asked for: any other episode has no record to send, and the payload names records by
episode and last tic, with the episode number restarting with the payload, so a much older request could find a
different file (the comparison would say so, but there is no point asking).

The file comes down as a CFDP transfer into Yamcs's bucket cfdpDown; there is no file on disk to watch, so the wait
is a sensor that reads Yamcs (command history, events, the CFDP transfer list) and never writes to it: on a
timeout the transfer is left alone. The command is never retried by itself: a failed run is re-requested by hand
(clear it in the UI). The tasks around it retry, and report_downlink_events says why no record came:
record_unavailable (SendFile refused, or the file could not be opened or was empty), record_transfer_failed (the
transfer began and failed) or record_not_received (no answer within the wait). A record that arrived although F'
never acknowledged Yamcs's Finished PDU is ingested, and record_fin_unacknowledged says so.
