"""Episode closure and windows: doomsat_sds.episodes decides which episodes are finished and which stretch of
the archive belongs to each, and every product (L1, L2, the catalog id, the Airflow run id) inherits that answer.

There is no "episode over" message, and the events that stand in for one have holes (docs/plans/sds-airflow.md,
"What the code says", facts 1-2): a flight's first EpisodeStarted is never archived, a RESET_GAME ends an episode
with no PlayerDied or LevelFinished, F' re-announces the running episode when it restarts, and EPISODE starts again
at 1 when the payload restarts (in this repo's first flight, episode 1 was followed by another episode 1). A wrong
closure loses an episode or catalogs one twice; a wrong window mixes two episodes into one record. The last class
replays a real recording of the live archive (two deaths) and checks the window computed live for episode 2.
