"""Doom payload: the "instrument" the flight software carries.

Runs Doom (via ViZDoom) at 35 Hz, keeps the last uplinked controls held, and serves an observation
summary plus JPEG frames (and the map it builds) to the F Prime Doom component over a local TCP socket.

Everything the payload reports comes from what a player could see, never from the level file:
  - the in-game automap in the mode that shows only lines the player has already seen. ZDoom draws
    those lines by category (wall, floor step, ceiling change such as a door, locked door in the
    colour of its key, exit line once looked at); the payload only recolours them so code can read
    the categories off the pixels,
  - the depth buffer (a range camera): free space ahead, and the map cells swept clean of unknown,
  - the labels buffer (an object detector): visible enemies, pickups and keys, remembered once seen,
  - the HUD variables: health, armor, ammo, position and heading (odometry).

There is no route planner. The payload reports, for the four directions around the player, how far
the way is open and how much of that ground has already been walked, what is at arm's length ahead
(a wall, a door, the exit switch, a locked door, something the map does not show), where an exit
line or a key or a pickup was seen, and whether the player is stuck. The ground decides where to go.

        already been seen, and it is self-correcting: climb the step and the sweep from up there maps what
        is beyond. Conservative about ground it has only looked at, not about ground it has stood on.
