"""The payload's own record of each episode, written as a small file the ground can downlink (SDS Phase D).

Off unless the payload runs with --records on (scripts/flight.sh: RECORDS=on). Then, for every episode, it
keeps a running account of what the payload itself sent: how many STATUS records, the first and last tic, the
final values, a position every second of game time, and the launch context (WAD, map, skill, seed). When the
episode ends it writes $DOOMSAT_HOME/run/rec/<episode>-<last tic>.json. The ground's science data system
asks for that file with FileDownlink's SendFile, and checks it against the Level 1 record it built
from the Yamcs archive: same episode, same ending, and how many of the statuses sent actually reached the ground.

The name carries the last tic because the episode number restarts with the payload; the ground knows both (the
PlayerDied/LevelFinished event says the tic), so it can name the file without asking the payload anything. Keep
it short: F' takes command strings of at most 39 characters.

Nothing on board reads these files. The accumulator is a write-only account of the current episode, started
afresh with every new episode and never consulted by the world model, the executor or the pilot (charter 2.2: no
map survives an attempt). A failure to write is reported and ignored; it can never stop the game.
