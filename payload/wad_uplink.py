"""LOAD_WAD on the payload side: the two link records, and which file names the game may be pointed at.

The operator uplinks a WAD (F' file packets into the uplink directory, renamed into place by the Doom
component once FileUplink has verified it) and commands LOAD_WAD; the Doom component forwards the three
names as record kind 0x16, and the payload answers with a WAD report, kind 3. The payload also sends a
report when the link comes up, so the ground always knows which file the game is running.

Pure Python with no ViZDoom, so the unit tests import it from the ground venv. Nothing here reads a WAD:
names are checked as text and looked up with os.path, and the game is the only thing that ever opens one
(charter 2.4, test 2).

    flight -> payload  kind 0x16  iwad, pwad ('' for none), map
    payload -> flight  kind 3     result:u8 loads:u16, then iwad, pwad (what the game runs now),
                                  name (what the request asked for), map, reason
