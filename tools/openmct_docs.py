NOTES = {
    # displays
    "00 Mission overview": "The front-room wall. One screen that answers two questions: is this attempt going well, and does anything need a person. Status strip on top, the player's view, vitals and the sector radar in the middle, and the last few seconds of the loop (events, the candidate board, the ground brain) along the bottom.",
    "10 GAME · the payload": "Doom's player read as a spacecraft payload: what it sees, what it is carrying, what is around it, and the map it has drawn so far.",
    "20 ONBOARD · flight side": "Everything onboard: the payload's world model and executor, the F´ flight computer, and the image products going down.",
    "30 GROUND · the other half of the loop": "Everything on the ground: the pilot, jev (System One) and Sonnet (System Two), the ground data system, and the record of what went up and what came down.",
    "40 TIME STRIP · one clock for everything": "The attempt on one time axis: the campaign plan, the camera, hull and consumables, decision timing, events and coverage. Scroll the time conductor and every lane moves together.",
    "50 AFTER-ACTION": "Post-flight review. The research ledger's chart of every attempt, the campaign as a list, the Grader Wall and links out to Yamcs and the charter.",
    "60 POCKET · phone view": "The overview cut down for a phone: four indicators, the camera, seven numbers.",
    # tabs
    "World model and executor": "What the onboard world model offered the ground, what jev thought of it, where the player has walked and what the executor is doing about it.",
    "Flight software (F´)": "The F´ deployment as a flight computer: rate group timing and slips, CPU and memory, the command dispatcher, the event logger, health pings and the com buffer pool.",
    "Downlink products": "The JPEG frame product: frames and 960-byte chunks sent, the size of the last frame, and chunks per frame.",
    "Autonomy: jev and Sonnet": "The decision loop on the ground: how long a decision takes against the 900 ms budget, how many intent changes jev actually decided (the charter's 70% floor), how clear-cut each pick was, and what jev and Sonnet said last.",
    "Ground data system": "The ground half of the link: frame reassembly and loss, and the rate at which the pilot sends commands up.",

    "Mission status strip": "Seven indicators and the numbers a flight director glances at: level, attempt, game time against the 180 s budget, kills, the current intent, cells seen, keys held.",
    "Vitals": "Hull integrity as a dial, shielding and consumables as meters, then weapon, hazards and range, the exit if one has been recognised, and what is at arm's length.",
    "Pocket status": "The four indicators that matter on a phone: hull, intent mode, decision timing, payload link.",
    "Grader wall (post-flight only)": "The grader's overlay of the attempt on the true level geometry. WAD-derived, so post-flight only: no live screen links here, and nothing here is read by the pilot, jev or Sonnet.",

CUSTOM_VIEWS = """Both DoomSat views follow the time conductor. In real time they update live, and the plan view's traverse keeps to the conductor's window. In Fixed mode they show the last values inside the bounds and take no live data, so a review holds still while the flight goes on.

### Sector Radar

Forward is up and left is left, as the player sees it. Each of the eight wedges is one direction the payload senses (FWD, AL, LEFT, BL, BACK, BR, RIGHT, AR). A wedge's **length** is the open way in that direction, up to 400 map units (the dotted rings are 100, 200, 300 and 400): the map ray, except forward, where it is the range camera (CLEAR_FWD). Its **fill** is how much of the ground that way has never been walked: pale is walked, bright green is new, and the percentage is printed inside, or **new** where the map has not seen the ground on the way. An **orange bar** across a wedge is a door at that distance. Markers: a **red dot** is the nearest enemy in view (with the count and range), a **green triangle** the exit once recognised, a **yellow triangle** a remembered key, and small dots the nearest health (+HP), ammunition (AMMO) and armor (ARM) pickups. A **dashed magenta line** is Sonnet's exploration hint while it is in force. The top line gives the heading and whether the executor reports STUCK; the bottom line what is at arm's length.

### Candidate Board

Left: the candidates the onboard world model is offering this decision, one row per slot (t0 to t7): kind, jev's score on the nine-level rubric with a bar, path units along the seen floor, the unseen cells behind it (a count, 255 at most), and live things near it. The picked row is highlighted. The header gives the intent mode, the picked slot, the gap to the runner-up, jev's confidence, and **by**: who decided (JEV in green, anything else in orange; see DecisionSource). `n/r` means the value is not in the dictionary or not in the recording. Right: a north-up plan view. The pale line is the player's traverse within the time conductor's bounds (POS_X and POS_Y paired by time), circles are the candidates coloured by kind and sized by score, the dashed white line runs from the player to the pick, and the white tick is the heading."""
