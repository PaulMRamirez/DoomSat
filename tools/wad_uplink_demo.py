"""Send a level to the running spacecraft and switch the game to it, printing the evidence as it goes.

    ground/.venv/bin/python tools/wad_uplink_demo.py --wad PATH [--iwad NAME] --map MAP
    uv run tools/wad_uplink_demo.py ...                      (the same, with the PEP 723 header above)

1. The file goes into a Yamcs bucket, then up the command link through the F' file transfer service
   (fprime-yamcs's FprimeFilePacketService: Fw::FilePacket Start, Data, End on APID 3) to
   <remote-dir>/NAME.<nonce>.part on the spacecraft.
2. FileUplink checks the checksum (FileReceived); the Doom component then renames it to NAME (WadUplinked).
   Only that event says the file is there whole: the service calls an upload complete once it has SENT it.
   On the CFDP build (docs/plans/cfdp-stage2-spike.md: Yamcs runs a cfdp service, the flight software
   cfdpManager) the file goes up as CCSDS CFDP class 2 instead (--cfdp 1 or 2 to choose). cfdpGuard commits a
   class 2 file on board as the spacecraft's FIN goes out (UploadCommitted naming this upload's .part, then
   WadUplinked). COMMIT_WAD is the fallback for the rest: those events lost, a build without the guard, or class 1
   once RxFileTransferCompleted comes with no RxCrcMismatch (class 1 has no retransmission: not for WADs).
   COMMIT_WAD carries the size and CFDP checksum of what was sent, and the Doom component renames the file
   only if it has both (WadCommitRefused otherwise). --checksum FILE prints the two, for a commit by hand.
   It is safe to send again: with the .part gone, a NAME that already has that size and checksum answers
   WadUplinked as the first commit did.
3. LOAD_WAD; the payload proves the game starts on it in a child process, then switches (WadLoaded) or keeps
   flying what it had (WadLoadFailed). The tool shows WAD_IWAD / WAD_PWAD / WAD_LOADS, EPISODE and
   FRAMES_SENT, and saves the first whole frame from after the switch in out/. LOAD_WAD is safe to send again
   too: one for the files and map already flying answers WadLoaded and leaves WAD_LOADS where it was.

What is loaded: with --iwad, the uplinked file is the PWAD over that IWAD; without, it is the IWAD. With no
--wad, nothing is uplinked and LOAD_WAD names files already on board (--iwad, --pwad).

Negative cases: --truncate N sends only the first N bytes (the game must refuse it); --load-early issues
LOAD_WAD while the file is still arriving (it must be refused, and the uplink still completes);
--expect-fail makes a refusal the success. --latency N measures CONTROL round trips (command up, the onboard
CMDS_RECEIVED count back down) N times before and N times during the uplink: run it without a pilot, whose
own commands would be counted too.

Uplinked-WAD flights are demonstrations. They are never benched or graded: the dev set is Freedoom Phase 1
and the test set the shareware episode (charter 2.5), and this tool is not part of either.
